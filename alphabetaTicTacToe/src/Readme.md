# TicTacToe game with minimax and alpha-beta pruning in Java
This project implements the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for the game of TicTacToe (also known as OXO or Noughts and Crosses) in Java.

## Features
- Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal decision-making.
- Simple console-based user interface for playing against the AI.
- Ability to play as either player (X or O).
- Comments and documentation for better code readability.
- Easy to extend for other games or more complex strategies.

Example of board state:
```
 X | O | X
-----------
   | X | O
-----------
 O |   | X
```

## Getting Started
Main class: `appli/TicTacToeGame.java`


- adapt the AI level ((see ``evaluate`` method in ``Situation.java`` and/or values in ``SpecialSituations.java``))
